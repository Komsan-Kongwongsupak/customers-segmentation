# Customers Segmentation

This repository contains the code and analysis for segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a valuable technique in marketing and business analytics that helps identify distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics. By understanding the unique needs and preferences of each customer segment, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

In this project, we explore a dataset of customer purchase history and apply various clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their buying patterns. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and create customer segments that can be used for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Contents

- `customers-segmentation.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for customer segmentation.
- `data`: A directory that should contain the dataset used for the analysis (not included in this repository).

## Requirements

To run the notebook and replicate the analysis, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
